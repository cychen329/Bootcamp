%Question 1 Fibonacci Series upto 10 terms
#HW1
#Problem 1 (Fibonacci Series up to 10 terms)
n1 = 0 #let the first term be 0
n2 = 1 #let the second term be 1
terms = 10 #There are 10 terms in total

print("Fibonacci Series up to 10 terms:")
for _ in range(terms): #so this will repeat 10 times since terms=10
    print (n1, end=" ") #it will print the first term up to the whatever the last term is
    next_term = n1 +n2 #the next term is defined by the sum of previous two terms
    n1 = n2 #the new first term is replaced by the previous second term
    n2 = next_term #the new second term is the sum of the previous two terms. n3 is n2 and following.

#Problem 2 (Display numbers at the odd indices of a list)
a = list(range(11)) #we define a list that is from 0 to 10
print(a[1:11:2]) #it starts at 1, ends at 11, and jump by 2

#Problem 3 (string)
string = """
My international student journey. I started my international student journey since I was 16,
I participated the exchange student program for a year, after that I decided to keep studying in the US.
I went to Washington state for community college, and finished my bachelor degree in UC,San Diego. 
After finished my bachelor degree, I went back home to work and realized that I want to study engineering.
In the end, I decided to study my master in NYU, I'm very satisfied with my choice.
Overall, I like every part of my educational journey in the US, they all give me good experience."""

#Problem 4 (Vowel Function)

    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"  # Define vowels both uppercase and lowercase

    return count
word = input("Enter a word: ")  # Ask the word input
print(f"Number of vowels in '{word}': {count_vowels(word)}")

#Problem 5 (print each one in all caps.)
animals = ['tiger', 'elephant', 'monkey', 'zebra', 'panther'] #Define the list called animals, that includes several animals
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.upper()) #that will make every iteration in uppercase.

#Problem 6 (Write a program that iterates from 1 to 20, printing each number and whether it's odd or even.)
for num in range (1,21):  #This give numbers 1-20
    if num %2 ==0: #If the remainder is 0, print the number is even
        print(str(num) + "is even")
    else: #anything besides even number are odd number
        print(str(num) + "is odd")

#Problem 7 (Write a function sum_of_integers(a, b) that takes two integers as input from the user and returns their sum)
def sum_of_integers(a,b): #define the function that gives result of a + b
    return a+b
number_1 = int(input("Your choice of first integer")) #Ask the number and make the choice become integer type
number_2 = int(input("Your choice of second integer"))
result = sum_of_integers(number_1,number_2)
print(str(number_1)+" + "+str(number_2)+" is "+str(result))
