#1⁠ ⁠How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
First, fomulate a hypothesis. 
Second, choose a significant value. 
Third, choose a appropriate test to perfrom. 
Fourth, check the p value, and compare to the significant value. 
Fifth, see the hypothesis should exist or not.

#2 What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
When you can a bunch of samples, the averages will start to form a normal distribution, even if the orignal data isn't normal distribution. 
This is important, because real world data is usually not in normal distribution, but Central Limit Theorem makes the data becoes normal distribution. 
We can use the normalization distribution data to perform tests, and it can help us to predict our hypothesis.

#3 What is the statistical power?
Statistical power is the probability that a test will correctly detect a real effect. 
Example: When you perfrom a data, it tells you reject the null hypothesis when it’s actually false.

#4 How do you control for biases?
Designing carefully, analyzing objectively, and checking your assumptions.

#5 ⁠What are confounding variables?
A confounding variable is something that affects both the thing you're testing and the outcome, and it can mess up your results.
It’s a hidden factor that makes it look like there’s a connection between two things, when really, there isn’t — or not as strong as it seems.
Example: People who carry lighters are more likely to get lung cancer. (there's no direct relation)

#6 What is A/B testing?
A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of something to see which one works better.

#7 What are confidence intervals?
A confidence interval is a range of values that’s likely to contain the true value (like the true average) of something you're measuring.
Example: Survey a sample of people and find their average height is 170 cm. 
You calculate a 95% confidence interval: [168 cm, 172 cm]
It means "We are 95% confident that the true average height of the whole population is between 168 and 172 cm."
